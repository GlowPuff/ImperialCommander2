**Imperial Commander** is a companion app for Fantasy Flight Games' *Star Wars: Imperial Assault*. The app attempts to eliminate the need for an Imperial player by taking over the task to deploy, manage, and control Imperial figures. It is directly inspired by FFG's own app *Legends of the Alliance* and the card-based *RedJak's Automated Imperial Variant*. It can be used to play all boxed campaigns, any side mission, and even custom missions.

To use **Imperial Commander**, you need a physical copy of the core game as well as any expansions you wish to use. Otherwise, you won't be able to use this app.

Star Wars, the Star Wars logo, and all other logos, characters, artwork, stories, information, names, and other elements associated with it are the sole and exclusive property of Lucasfilm Limited. Star Wars: Imperial Assault and its expansions are Â© Fantasy Flight Publishing.
