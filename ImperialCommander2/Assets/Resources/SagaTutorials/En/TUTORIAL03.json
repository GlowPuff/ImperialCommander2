When doing this, the large figure must still occupy at least half of the spaces it occupied before the rotation. However, this is only necessary for figures with an asymmetrical base. The orientation does not play any role in determining the direction of movement or attack.\r\n{-} Large figures are subject to all movement requirements for terrain and other figures, but they are subject to these requirements only once per movement point spent. For example, if an E-Web Engineer moves into two spaces containing Rebel figures, it must only spend one additional movement point instead of two.",
