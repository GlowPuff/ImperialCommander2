<b>RETURN TO HOTH SPECIAL RULES</b>
{-} The Time Period for the <i>Return to Hoth</i> campaign is 5.
{-} Shuffle the four Threat Mission cards and place them in a deck near the Side Mission deck.
{-} When creating the Side Mission deck, choose only two green Side Mission cards and include only two random gray Side Mission cards.
{-} If you just resolved the introductory mission, shuffle the Side Mission deck and draw two cards. Then, draw two cards from the Threat Mission deck. Those four cards are now active missions.
{-} Threat missions function similarly to side missions, except that they give the Empire access to Bane Reward cards as long as they are active missions. When choosing side missions during the campaign, the heroes may choose to resolve a threat mission instead of another side mission to remove the Bane Reward card and gain Boon Reward cards.
{-} Remove the Bane Reward card <b>Constant Advantage</b>. When this card comes up during the campaign, replace it with a different randomly drawn Bane Reward card.

{-} Set aside the Deployment cards, gray figures, map tiles, doors, and the objective, terminal, and crate tokens.

{-} For a two-hero game, each hero also takes a "Legendary" Reward card. For a three-hero game, each hero takes a "Heroic" Reward card.
{-} Create the Side Mission deck by shuffling together the following cards: Each red Side Mission card (personal missions) corresponding to the selected heroes, two green cards (ally missions) of the players' choice, two random gray cards (general side missions).
