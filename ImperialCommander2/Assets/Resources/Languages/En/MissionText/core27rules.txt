<b>At the beginning of each Round after the event <color="red">Find the Droid</color> is resolved:</b>
If the memory core is not retrieved, place 1 Imperial Officer on the core or adjacent to it. If possible, first use figures set aside, then from Manual Deployment. The Imperial Officer immediately retrieves the memory core.

When the Imperial Officer carrying the memory core moves on the Entrance, he escapes with the memory core. If the Imperial Officer is defeated, set his figure aside instead. (It still counts as defeated for the purpose of triggering effects.) As long as the Imperial Officer is not on the map, exhaust his deployment group.

<b>Mission instructions (add to the <color="red">top</color> of the instruction list):</b>
The Imperial Officer carrying the memory core gains:
