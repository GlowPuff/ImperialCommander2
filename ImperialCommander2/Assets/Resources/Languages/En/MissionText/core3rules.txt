<b>Mission instructions (add to the <color="red">top</color> of the instruction list):</b>
All <b>Imperial Officers</b> and <b>Probe Droids</b> gain:

â–  Interact with a terminal to increase <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">D</font> by 2 (only once per round per terminal).

As long as the door is closed, <b>Weiss</b> gains:

<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">A</font> ORDER: Another Imperial figure with a figure cost of 8 or less that can perform an attack attacks <<the closest healthy Rebel>>.
<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">A</font> The other Imperial figure with the highest figure cost becomes Focused.

When the door is open, <b>Weiss</b> instead gains:

<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">Q</font> Attack <<the closest healthy Rebel>>.
<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">A</font> Move 3 to interact with the inactive AT-ST.
<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">A</font> Move 6 toward the inactive AT-ST.

<b><color="red">Vulnerable:</color></b>
Ignore the two options. Instead:

<b>If the door is already open:</b> Weiss recovers 5 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">H</font> and interrupts to attack <<the closest healthy Rebel>>.
<b>If the door is still closed, or Weiss has not suffered any</b> <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">H</font> <b>and is not within line of sight of a Rebel:</b> Open the door. Weiss moves 3 toward the AT-ST.
