An Imperial figure cannot perform more than two actions during its activation. An instruction costs one action for each {A} (action) or {Q} (attack action) icon preceding it. If the figure does not have enough actions remaining for an instruction, that instruction is skipped. Unless stated otherwise, an Imperial figure can never perform more than one {Q} (attack action) per activation."
