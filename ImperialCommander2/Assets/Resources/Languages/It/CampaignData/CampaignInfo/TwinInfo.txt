<b>TWIN SHADOWS SPECIAL RULES</b>
{-} Each hero receives 3 XP and heroes collectively receive 400 credits per hero. Then, heroes resolve a Rebel Upgrade Stage. When purchasing Item cards during this Rebel Upgrade Stage, Rebel players draw cards from the Tier 1 Item deck.

<b>GENERAL SETUP</b>
{-} Set aside the dice, Condition cards, and the damage, strain, and condition tokens.
{-} Remove the card "Troop Data" from the Supply card deck and return it to the game box, then shuffle the Supply deck.
{-} Set aside the Deployment cards, gray figures, map tiles, doors, and the objective, terminal, and crate tokens.
{-} Each player selects a hero to play (at least two if playing single-player) and gathers the Hero sheet, figure, Hero Class deck, and starting items that correspond to that hero.
{-} For a two-hero game, each hero also takes a "Legendary" Reward card. For a three-hero game, each hero takes a "Heroic" Reward card.
