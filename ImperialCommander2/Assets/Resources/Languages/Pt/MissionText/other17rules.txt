<color="red">The AT-ST</color>
Deploy the reserved <color="red">AT-ST</color>. It now activates as normal.

If there are Rebel figures within 6 spaces and line of sight, the <color="red">AT-ST</color> moves 1 to attack <<the closest healthy Rebel>>. The attack gains +1 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">H</font> and +2 Accuracy.

Otherwise, increase <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">D</font> by the threat level.
