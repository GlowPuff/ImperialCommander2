<b>Mission instructions (add to the <color="red">top</color> of the instruction list):</color>
Before <color="red">No More Games</color> is resolved, <color="red">Thrawn</color> gains:

■ Ignore the bonus effect LONG-LAID PLANS.
■ REMOTE PATIENCE: The other X highest figure cost Imperial figures gain 1 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">h</font> and 1 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">g</font>. X is equal to the number of exhausted Rebel activation tokens.
■ REMOTE LONG-LAID PLANS: The other X highest figure cost Imperial figures gain 1 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">h</font>. X is the number of the current round.

After <color="red">Thrawn's Snare</color> is resolved, all figures gain:

■ When attacking, this figure discards 1 insight from the target's hero sheet if possible. If insight was discarded, add 1 red die to your attack pool.

<color="red">Thrawn's Snare:</color>
Deploy <color="red">Thrawn</color>, but set his figure aside. When he activates, refer to the mission instructions.

Insight can not be discarded to remove attack dice. Instead, all heros with at least 1 insight on their hero sheets apply -1 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">H</font> to each attack.

<color="red">No More Games:</color>
Deploy <color="red">Thrawn's</color> set-aside figure to the Trophy Room. <color="red">Thrawn</color> now activates with his usual instructions.
