<b>Mission Instructions (add to the top of the instruction list:)</b>
The Imperial Officer carrying the schematics gains:

<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">A</font> Move 4 toward the blue terminal.
<font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">A</font> Move 4 toward the blue terminal.
â–  When adjacent to the blue terminal, upload the schematic.

<b>When an Imperial figure moves adjacent to the red terminal for the first time:</b>
Deploy the regular Imperial Officer to a space adjacent to the red terminal. The Imperial Officer interrupts to retrieve the schematic.

If the Imperial Officer carrying the schematic is defeated, set his figure aside instead and do not defeat the deployment group. (It still counts as defeated for the purpose of triggering effects.) As long as the Imperial Officer is not on the map, exhaust his deployment group. At the beginning of next round, place him on the space of the schematic again. He immediately retrieves the schematic.
