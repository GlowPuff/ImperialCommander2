<b>Bombarding the structure:</b>
Bombarding the structure does not require line of sight. Instead, use the following rules:

Every time the structure is bombarded, choose the Rebel figure closest to the red point. Place 1 imperial mission token on that figure's space.
All Rebel figures within 2 spaces of the token suffer 1 <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">H</font>.
If an Imperial figure has line of sight of the Rebel, the Rebel additionally becomes Stunned.
