<color="red">High Alert:</color>
In addition to increasing <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">D</font>, each time a Rebel figure performs an attack, place 1 strain token in the Imperial play area.

If there are 8 strain tokens in the Imperial play area, remove them, decrease <font="ImperialAssaultSymbols SDF">D</font> by 2 and place 1 Imperial mission token in the Imperial play area.

The round counter is the current round plus the number of Imperial mission tokens in the Imperial play area.

These rules apply until <color="red">The Ambush</color> is resolved.
